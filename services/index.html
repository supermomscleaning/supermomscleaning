          <li>Does Supermom bring her own cleaning supplies?</li>
          <li>Yes! Supermom provides her own cleaning supplies for any type of cleaning necessary. If you have a preference of brand or type of supplies, let her know before your scheduled cleaning.</li>
          <li>What does "COVID-19 certified" mean?</li>
          <li>Supermom takes the pandemic seriously and will do everything she can to keep herself and her clients safe. Currently, she serves 13 clients on a regular or semi-regular basis. Supermom will wear a mask to all first-meetings and interviews, as well as going the extra mile to keep surfaces clean and disinfected.</li>
